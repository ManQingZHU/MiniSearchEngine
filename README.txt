We have downloaded the code for handling word stemming for the Internet. The site is https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/ .
We made some adjustments and wrote Stemming.cpp and Stemming.h .

The file folder for this program contains a makefile. You can easily use it to get an exe file.

The file folder named "documents" contains a "index.txt", which includes all the title of Shakespeare's work. You are expected to put text version of Shakespeare's work in here, so the program will do operation correctly.

If your computer system is OS X, use the code in main.cpp from line 89 - 97, then makefile.
 
If your computer system is Windows, use the code in main.cpp line 97.Also, you can use SearchEngine_win derictly.
